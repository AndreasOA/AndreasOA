## Hey there, I’m Andreas 👋

I’m a full-time Data Scientist and part-time AI Master’s student, who started tinkering with electronics and somehow ended up bossing around datasets. When I’m not convincing Python to do my bidding, I’m building dashboards that are *totally* not just pie charts with extra steps.

### What’s in My Repo Wonderland?

- **Machine Learning & AI:** Models, models, and (wait for it) more models—because who doesn’t love watching computers guess stuff?
- **Python Scripts:** Neat little programs that fix problems you didn’t know you had. Or break things you didn’t know could break.
- **UI Adventures:** From browser-based dashboards to React Native apps and even a tiny Swift detour, I’m all about giving data a stylish makeover it never asked for.

### Street Cred

- **Electronics Background:** Before code, I played with circuits. Electricity: just another form of wizardry.
- **AI Studies:** Working on my Master’s, so one day I can say “I told you so” when the robots take over.

So go ahead, peek into my repos, steal some code, and maybe learn something—or just pretend you did. I won’t judge.
